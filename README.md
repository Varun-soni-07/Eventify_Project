The backend of this project is built using Spring Boot with Spring Security and JWT to provide secure authentication, role-based access, encrypted passwords, and fully RESTful APIs for event creation, management, and user registration. It uses a layered architecture with JPA for database operations and ensures clean, scalable, and secure backend workflows. The frontend, built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, interacts with these APIs using Fetch and displays events to users through a clean and responsive interface.
